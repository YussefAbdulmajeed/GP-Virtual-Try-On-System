Developed a Segmentation Generator (U2-net) using an encoder-decoder architecture for precise image segmentation tasks.
Implemented a Geometric Matching Module (GMM) with feature extraction, correlation, and thin plate spline transformations for accurate alignment.
Designed a Conditional Normalization Layer (ALIASNorm) incorporating segmentation and mask information, enhancing image synthesis results.
Constructed an ALIAS Generator for progressive image upscaling, leveraging advanced residual block design for superior image quality.
